# Mouse seeking cheese

Riddle proposed by big brother : a mouse seeks a cheese into a labyrinth. You're allowed to use two functions :
- **success()** which returns if the cheese is on the mouse's tile
- **move(direction)** which returns if the movement succeeded (no wall in stead)

The solution used includes recursion.
